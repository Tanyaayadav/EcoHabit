## 🎯 Goals

High-level goals (priority order):

1. Launch a functional MVP that helps users track and sustain eco-friendly habits.

## 🚩 Key Pain Points

- Users struggle to maintain new habits due to lack of time, motivation, or external support systems.
- Individuals feel their efforts are insignificant without broader collective action.
- Existing solutions lack personalization and emotional engagement in sustainability efforts.

## 🧠 Key Logic

### 🔹 Personalization Algorithm
- Uses machine learning to analyze user behavior.
- Suggests habits and content based on success rate, frequency, and feedback.
- Continuously adapts to user progress.

### 🔹 Impact Measurement
- Integrates publicly available environmental data (e.g., CO2 emissions per kWh).
- Converts raw data into relatable metrics such as:
  - Gallons of water saved
  - Wildlife protected
- User actions earn points for virtual and real-world rewards.

### 🔹 Error & Edge Case Handling
- Gentle reminders for missed habit logs instead of penalties.
- Alternative suggestions if a habit is not feasible for the user.

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Low initial user retention  
Mitigation:
- Engaging onboarding flow
- Interactive tutorials
- Early positive reinforcement

### Risk: Lack of habit completion data in MVP  
Mitigation:
- Focus on lightweight, achievable habits in early stages.
- Encourage small daily wins.
